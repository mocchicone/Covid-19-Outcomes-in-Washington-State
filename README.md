#  **COVID-19 Outcomes in Washington State:**

Analyzed Covid-19 data from Washington State to understand the relationship between income, poverty, political affiliation, and age with Covid-19 outcomes: cases, hospitalizations, deaths.

Extracted data from the CDC, Census, and usa.com to assemble a dataset of over 50,000 cases.

Linear regression, Chi-Square, outlier analysis, and visualizations conducted using Python, Pandas, Plotly, and Matplotlib.

## **Summary:** 

Our team was interested in exploring some lesser studied predictor variables for Covid-19 outcomes.  We decided to focus our research to Washington State to limit the scope of the project.  

## **Hypotheses:**

H1A: Washington counties grouped by political affiliation will show a significant difference in Covid-19 outcomes (cases, hospitalizations, and deaths).

H2A: Mean household income will negatively correlate to Covid-19 outcomes (cases, hospitalizations, and deaths).

H3A: Poverty rate will positively correlate to Covid-19 outcomes (cases, hospitalizations, and deaths).

Additionally, age and Covid-19 outcomes were examined visually.

## **Conclusions**



    a) for democrat leaning counties income was significantly and positively correllated to all three outcomes.


    a) for democrat leaning counties poverty rate was significantly and negatively correllated to hospitalizations



a) a significant difference was found for cases (Republican leaning counties > Democratic leaning counties)
